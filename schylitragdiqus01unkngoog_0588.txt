specimen of your literary merite, by quoting some of
your own notes. It is singular, that in the whole
Review of my bopk, there is not a single quotation, by
which the reader may form any thing like an opinion of
it. One note alone, and that note only consisting of
two lines and a half, is 'quot'ed in the whole review

and quoted for the purpose of a petulant and unbecom·

shame left, he will' blush to have made.—I should have
