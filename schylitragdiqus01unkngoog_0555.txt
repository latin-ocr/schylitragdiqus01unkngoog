The Reviewer confessas himself hampeted with the
difficulty arising from the uniform agreement of the
MSS. in δάπιδα, and 1, who see no reason for changing
the MSS. when· it makes good senseand is confirmed
by a hundred other-instances, am quite content with
δάπιδα here, and quite nnmoved by the· Reviewer’a
argument, which* m fact amunte ιο nothing. -His as-
aei-tion of the transcribet-s being more used to Homer

Good Heavens! can you, my dear Sir, sufficiently ad-
mire the felicity with which the Reviewer blundera?
A vasious reading, as 1 conceive, means a reading
different from the reading of the text. Now as the

one MS? are exactly the same, 1 cannotsee by what
right 1 am ιο be blamed for omitting in the vau-r. Lectt.
