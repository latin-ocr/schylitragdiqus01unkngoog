But when, in the name of somme, did Mr. Butler lenm
to talk of the elegam of this commentator, which in a.
topic he iusim on in frequent laudatory remarks? May
we not expect to hear of the elegant Le Clerlz, the
elegant Pauw, the' elegant Bothe? What possible chin
an editor can have to thia epithet who posseoeeo neither
learning, taste, nor literary honeety, we are at a loen to
conceive.”-1 would ask the Reviewer if he does hear of
the elegant Le clerc, the elegant Pauw, or the elegant
Bothe? Oris 1 have in fact applied that epithet to then

From his own unrivalled height, that truly learned man
looked down on inferior scholare with too much fastidi..
ousness. But if he, from hia acknowledged pre-emi-
nence, had a right to consider the generality of scholam
as beneath him, and if, with a weakness which certainly
one could have wished he had not indulged, he some-
times spelte of them too slightingly, are hia juveni}-
,disciples entitled to the same liberty?

It hus been my great object, throughout my whole
work, to treat no scholar with asperity-to indulge in no
petulant aneera--no flippant sarcasmff-no contemptum»
irony. A scholar ought to be a geutleman. He ought to
have his manners and his disposition humanized by the
studies iu which he is engaged ς and if in the putauit of
them he only acquires a certain number of hard worda,
'and scattered fragments, and long and short syllabica, ho
