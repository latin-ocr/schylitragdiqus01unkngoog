what‘excuse has he for an insertion in direct opposition
ιὸ truth ι new win the Reviewer justify his declaration
that 1 h'ave taken nomotice of the remark of Professor
Porson on the Hec‚ v. 1125. when 1 refer him to
my words, ‘ 110535 defendit Heath ex Steph. Thesauro
et ‚Heathio 'longe doctior Porsonus, ad Eurip. Hec.
v.'1115.’ surely he wiu not avan himself of the idle
subterfuge that v. 111'5 is printed by error of the prees
for 1125, especially as Por'son has no note on v· 1115.
1‘ cannot think he will shelter himself under the mean-
ness of a typographical quibble, especially as he commite
more than a similar one in this very sentence, where, for
923, we should read 916.*

“ We are sornewhat surprised that Mt. Butler should

country town, he hu little occasion. fnr Greek typeu, and pos-enen
but a very small supply of tinem3 and the une of that small number

which han de'layed the publication of this letter very greatly. 1
heve therefore boen obliged, greatly to my mortificationi, to ahmin
from quoting and emending a variety of enac-nens from Achaeus
the Eretria, Plato Comicus, Sopater, Astydamas, &a &c- ἃς. &c-

should live to edit a single play of Euripides, to'gratify the learned
and overwhelm the antem-ned world, with a copious inundationi of
ffrssqin conjectures and unexceptionable canons.
