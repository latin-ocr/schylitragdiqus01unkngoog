Let me add also, end 1 add it in defence, not in
ostentation, that probably no man ever undertook a work
of this nauare with so little assistance. Of the many
thousand-and ten thousand passages Ι have had ω refer
to in antient authors, not one has been pointed out to
me by any learned friend 3 1 have received no hints, no
notes, no communicatione of any kind, except. those
which 1 have published with authors* names. 1 live in
a remote provincial town, far from the scats of learning,
the two Universities and the Metropolis. With the excep-
tion of my upper boys, 1 have no Porsonulettes at hand
whose n'dvice 1 can ask on intricate points, end to whom
,1 may communicate‘my notes asI write them; nor have
‚they ever been subjected to any eyes but that of an oc-
,annual amanuensis and the printer. Some indulgence
therefore must be granted, if, with au these disadvantages.
1 do now and then omit a reference. One cannot always
be equally alcrt, and 1 think almost every fair scholar wiu
rather be inclined to give me credit for having done ⁵9
much, than to blame me thet Ι have not done more. So
much for my own defence on this end au similar occasion.

Let us now see what the E. R‘a boast amounts to.
,He says, “ We will conclude our remarks on it with a list
‚of those passages in the play which are not noticed by the
:learned editor as being quoted by ⁸the antient authom.”

no specification.-1 may write down 820 numbers aad
