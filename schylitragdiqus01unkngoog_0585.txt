‘⁴ We cannot refiain from expressing our surprise,
⁸ that none of these emendations which the late Professor
communicated to his friends, should have reached ΜΓ.
Butler⁵s earu for we cannot help thinking that he
might have come to the knowledge of them without
much trouble. Such is the veneratior] which we feel fot
the name of Porsen, that we think it a duty incumbent
on every English Scholar, who is preparing an edition of
a Greek author, to enquire diligently what has been said
by that incomparablc scholar on the subject, aud to re·-
cord his opinions with deference and fidelity.”—My dear
Sir, whatever the Reviewer may think on this subject, I

am sure you will feel obliged to me. The surprise of the
Reviewer may cesse, when he learns that 1 did see the

late Professor⁴s emendations. The book was put into my

' ⁴ hands in Trinity Coll. Cambridge. But I was told at

the same time, that you was theu preparing an edition of
AEschylus for the press, and that you possessed these
emendations. They wore not offered to rue—and 1 did
not ask for them, because 1 thought, by 'so doing, 1
should disappoint your hopes of producing an attractive
novelty to your edition. 1 had no· jealousy lurking in
my mind that your edition might possibly interfere with
mine, which was just coming out; and had you, when 1
saw you, in a fair and manly way, said that you were
about such a work, I should have told you that 1 thought
the world quite wide enough sor you and me, and
should have been the last person living to have endea-
voured, by insidious depreciation, by a sly anonymous
cavil in a Review, or by any other means whatever, to
injure your feelings, o'r your reputation, or your advan-
tageS.-If I'had reviewed your book, and lveryfpossibly
might have done so, it would have been in the spirit of‘a

K scholar.
