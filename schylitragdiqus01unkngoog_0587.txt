“ We cannot refrain from expressing our surprise,
⁹ that none of these emendations which the late Professor
communicated to his friends, should have reached ΜΓ.
Butler⁹s ears3 for we cannot help thinking thet he
might have come to the knowledge of them without

much trouble. Such is the veneration which we feel for ⁷

the nume of Porsen, that we think it a duty incumbent
on every English Scholar, who is preparing an edition of
a Greek author, to enquire diligently what hus been said

AEschylus for the prese, and that you poaecssed these
emendations. They were not offered to me—-and 1 did

novelty to your edition. 1 had no· jealousy lurking in
my mind that your edition might possibly interfere with

about such a work, I should have told you that 1 thought

the world quite wide enough for you and me, and
should have been the last person living to have endea-
voured, by insidious depreciation, by a sly anonymous
cavil in a Review, or by any other means whatever, to
injure your feelingS, qr your reputation, or your advan-
tagesae-lf Ι had reviewcd your book, and 1 very'possibly

might heve done so, it would have been in the spirit of a
