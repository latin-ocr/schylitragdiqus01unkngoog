A LETTER, διο.

 

omn sm,

WREN the twenty-ninth number of the Edinburgh
Review reached me, Ῑ was sitting in a little back parlout
(where 1 'shall be very happy to nee you) at my Living
in Warwickshire, in the com'pnny of the most illustrious
scholar now living, from whose friendship an& society 1
derivo no small misfaefion. 1 wisb you had been
ef the party, forda! 1 cannot doecfibess to you how 1
became alternately pale and red, how⁸ Ι toembled, and
started somenam from my cluit, sometimes dashed the
book against the wall, and then picked it up agaim
sometimes clasped my hands, and sometime· shonki
have torn my hair, if my had had not luckilyboen
&vav-ed, ns 1 proceeded to read that profound imd elabo-
rate critique. Indeed, as the day was chin, the wind
lond, and the clouds lowering, 1 should probably have
net off in quest of the chade of AEaeohylue, by tho help of
‹ch-lter and a three-bgged wool, had 1 not been eom-
forted by the mumnoes of my eminendy learned friend,
that ho saw nothing in the remam of tho Edinburgh

B Raima,
