my. MS. most decidedly preferred Αἶνυῆοννῆς. 1 should
therefore have written, est enim synaloepha in ι. DE Qua
vide ad Persas, v. 35 ; for, while Ι oppone Brunck in the
passage referred to, Ι adduce a good many instancee of

synaloepha andsynizesis. But as this will come in the
form of a regular note, Ι must not now anticipate it.

“ Mt. Butler preferszz θ’ ; but we are of opinion that
Brunck is right3 for, by this alteration, we avoid a devi-
ation from the idiom of the Tragoedians, which requires
Ἲοαχιῒω σπερμά σὺ δι’. Stephanus Byz. in v. Ἰιαχία has
οἵ aptavit· n. 3 which is an evident corruption of σύ τ’.”

Greek scholar must be intuitively sensible of this, with-

“ V.769. has sadly perplexed the critice. We shallpass
ovcr their various conjectures 3 observing‘ merely, that ΜΓ.
Butler adopts the correction of Mr. Tatc, πρὶν avez γ’ αι ἐκ

of Brun'ck‚ viz. that the transposition of ἔγωγ’, and the
changing it into ίγῦ, materially weakens its force. But, in
our apprehension, the difficulty is to be surmounted by
