might have been something of condescension in such·
conduct-3 but in such a Colossal genius as Person, there
appearS, 1 must confess, somewhat of contempt sor hia
literary contemporaries, which 1 do not think wholly
justifiable. 1 have ventured these remarks with serious'·
neos and with fearlessness. They will not, 1 trust, offend

any liberal scholar, and for the bigoted or narrow·minded ⁸ ’

.1 am not much accustomed to care. 1 shall now return
to the E. R.

That the E. Reviewer is a Porsonian, admioe not
of a doubt. That he is amember of your very re·
spectable college is equally certain3 and this is an..
other reason sor my addressing you, that you may
be on your guard against him, and avoid him. My
deas Sir, let me advise you never to be seen in his
company, if you can help it; he will do you no
x credit, and it is ten to one but he will make you a aharer
in his disgrace. 1f he, still pumues yon, do try if you
can escape h'im by clambering up the sides of a copper
bottomed frigam, which is the best modern explanation
1 can find of that “ oerala triremi? honourably men-
tioned in my Delphin Horace, page 163.

Before 1 enter into an examination of the critique
itself, allow me ιο state ιο you two of the causes of the
‘⁶ capitale odiun»,” which the E. Reviewer appears to
entertain against me. You cannot be ignorant, my dear
Sir, that one way by which a young man, panting after
fame and eager for the prccocious enjoyment of it, some!
time· attempta to gaiu his object is, by attacking his
seniora. l knew a writing-master who rose in thia manner
to immortality hy a rampant⁴ assault on Sir Isaac
