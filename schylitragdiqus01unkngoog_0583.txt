Gteek vernes than ever eume from the pen of AEschylns,

yet 1 do nut think it fuir to give my choi-uses to the public
under hin nme. Suum cuique is my mono, nsit was the
Raviewer's, 1 suppose, when he stole your famem reading
of 'gb at· ἡνίᾶυ. But onthismbject it isbnt fairto
refer to my note on V. 917.

“ We scarcely know what to say of ν. 855, διο. except
that me conjectures of Mr. Butler and his learned friend
are equally inadmissible, since famu-Gau requires a genitive ,
case-”—The Reviewer is right. My friend made a blun- '
der, which Itoo hastily passed over-and 1 thank him for
this opportunity of amending it, for I disdain to conceal
it, or to call to my aid the ἔκεῖιο after μεθίημι in Phoeniss. ³
v. 522, which Porson has rightly corrected. But to say,
the truth, 1 did not sufficiently disengage my attention
from another passage of Euripides illustrative of this
(808 p. 62) Med. V. 558, pto-fuat “Px“ μίγεν χόλου, and 1
must therefore request the render to read here μιθῶω ἰὼ,
stead of μεθέσθαι, with the rest of my conjecture, till he

can extricata himself from this most corrupt passage by
the help of the patent canon, or some better aid.

V. 879. Here is along and insulting note of tlte Re-
viewer, in which he assumes what he' has no right to
nume, that 1 dnuot eeeanycorruption in a cormpt
passage of Hesychius, which he is so good, partly by the
help of the commenmors on Hesychius», in imitation of,
no lea aman then Bentley, to explain‘at his peril. 1
mmt once mone reunnd him, thet 1 make no excnruive·
‘criticisms in my notes, for substantial reasons already¹
migoedd* . ’

V. 8992
