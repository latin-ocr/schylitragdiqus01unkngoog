“ V. 4. Mt. Butler has not remarked that Porson re,
tained the old reading zmossaozn, without the article ; τε,
does not appear to us to be indispensable, tho' it improvae
the verse.”—Here 1 must once more apostrophize the
Reviewer, and say, My good Lad, Ι profess to give Varias
Lectiones, varias different lectiones readings. Now the
reading in the text of Stanley is ΔιτΊοβιοῢι, without the
article, and the reading in the text of Porson is Aen-'¹030-

to remark the hypercritical accuracy of the Reviewer, in
trying to lay sins of omission, though· groundlessly, tq
my charge. The remaining part of the sentence, in which
the Reviewer says that τῇ, is not indispensable though it
improoes the verse, reminds me of that judicious criti-
cism in the Spectator, where the commentator has but
two foolish reasons for preferring a certain reading ; first,
becauae the thyme, and secondly because the sense, was
preserved by it,

Passing over the intervening matter, which is not
my immediate concern, 1 corne to v, 84, which the
Reviewer reads teg„ θ’ {ripae στυγῧηκ, as if it ware so
printed in the text3 whereas it is ῦπίμυς in the text, and ³

should be added, deserves consideration, though hi,
interprention by no means satisfies me.

.“ An excellent conjecture of Bothe’s, in v. 101, is
