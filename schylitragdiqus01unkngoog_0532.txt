When the E. Reviewer my! nine MSS. he says the
truth, but not the whole truth.-The Cohspectus alluded
to, prefixed to my notes, enumerata exacdy twenty MSS.
besides MS. notes. of these ten MSS. are enumemted 2
as conated by Askew, two by stanley, und afterwards by .
Askew, that is in au twelve by Askew, four by Selium„
and four hitherto uncollated--two of which are collaoed
by. myself, and two communicated from Venice by the.
celebrated Abbe Mooelli. Now this must have been.
obvious to the E. Reviewer‚ not only from the oon-.

viewer, while he noticoewhat he supposes to be the
uneollhted· Medicean, says not a syllable about.the much
talked of Venetian MS. ‘which vae, if I mistake not, the
foundation of ΜΓ. Professor Porson’s refusal to nuder·
take the Edition of AEschylus. If lam rightly infor-med,
the Professor, wished the. Syndics to send him to Venice
for the purpose of collating this MS. and on their not
feeling author-ised to comply with this propoffl, -declined
to proceed in ''the edition. The last account Ihad of
this MS. is from the Abbe Metelli, who laments that
it-waz-carried off by the French from the librar-y of Sl.
Man-k, and states that he hears it was seen afterwards
in the hands of a Frencb soldier in a common pothouae
in Switzerland. I hope it has not shamd the fate of the
celebrated α(ιὴιιτιειειοουει.Μ8. of the Rev. Mr. Adams‚”
to which the E. R. in a Subsequent part of his remarks
