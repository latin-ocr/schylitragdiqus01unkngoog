as to the latinity) of J ustus Lipsius and Vincentiuss Obso-

modern commentatum, except some of the lucubrations

descensive civility, 1 begjeave to say, that Ι believe my
notes will be found as numerous as those of any othei:
commentator. It is very difficult to say what are sin·-
gularities of language. What one person, not widely
conversam with the circle of Greek literature, may think
a singulam, another, who has taken a. more extensive
range, and has enjoyed gromu- opportunities of remark,
may think no singulatity at all.1 remember, when a
boy, eagerly noting down meh words as ὅτων & nn> &-

that it uppem to mea very judifcious ones ne com-
pares cenain expressions οῖ’ AEschylus with others which
are put' into the mouth of Job ; and asoerts the superiority
of the sacred above the heathen writer. Mt. Manet
